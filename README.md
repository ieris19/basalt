# Basalt

_Basalt_ is a Java application designed to turn your **Obsidian Vaults** into
HTML documents ready for publishing. It is meant to be used as an alternative
to the ***Obsidian Publish*** service, minus the hosting.

_Basalt_ utilizes **Flexmark** to convert _Markdown to HTML_.
This means that while _Basalt_ is designed to work with **Obsidian**,
it should work with any Markdown files with slight adjustments.

## Features

_Basalt_ is a work in progress personal project.
It is not meant to be a replacement for ***Obsidian Publish*** but rather a
tool to help you publish your Obsidian Vault to the web in a way that you
can host yourself.
The goal is to make an easy-to-use tool that will allow you to turn your
Markdown files into a website with minimal effort.

_Basalt_ is currently in a very early stage of development.
As such, it is missing many features that are planned for the future.
The following is a list of features that are currently implemented or planned:

- [x] Convert Markdown files to HTML
- [ ] Full support for Obsidian's Markdown flavor
- [ ] Easy to use styling via CSS
- [ ] Convert Markdown files to PDF
- [ ] Webserver to transform Markdown files on the fly
